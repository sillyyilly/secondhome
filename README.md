# Second Home

##Inspiration

Every individual is unique, down to the way they like to organize and keep track of their busy life. We saw an opportunity to use Mappedin to provide a novel way to use indoor mapping to allow users to visualize their tasks and responsibilities. Each floor represents a broad category (school, work, personal, etc) and users are able to customize each floor down to the quantity and names of the rooms using Mappedinâ€™s Maker interface. This allows users to use a familiar interface of maps for a completely new function of personal organization.

## What it does

Users can build a custom floor plan and populate each floor and its rooms with different tasks in their life.
